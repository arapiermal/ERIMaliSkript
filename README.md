Features
Are you tired of Java and its bureaucracy, and would you like some programming in Albanian?

Near zero punctuation marks , ; and parentheses {}[]() needed

Space button and Enter (New Line) is your friend


### File
- Epic command to count how many times do the words of a text file repeat and show them (Using a HashMap for high efficiency)  
  Done through only one line of code: file numero book.txt

### Variables
#### Equation solver (Variables can get into it)
- Can use different types of parentheses {[(Stack is used)]}
- Besides the Java +-*/%, it also has ^ for power and _ for root ðŸ˜² (example: 5 ^ 2 = 25; 3 _ 125 = 5)
- Can solve {3*[5-2*(2-1)]-2}^2+4 (The result is 53)



### Arrays
- Index starts from 1 (More intuitive for the layman)
- Access them like #myArray@index (no need for [][][][][][])

### functions, for and if don't need (){}(){}(){}

---> 

---> To signify their end simply write 'kaq'
#### Functions: easy
funksion test a b  
printo vepro a + b  
kaq  
thirr test 2 3  
~ 5 is the result  
#### For cycle: simplified
- per 1 deri 10 ==> for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i ++)
- per a deri b ==> for(int i = a; i <= b; i++) (nese a < b)
- per 10 deri 1 ==> for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i--)
#### If
- Simplified if else {if - nqs (Ne qofte se); else - pn (perndryshe)}
- nqs a < b    
  printo E vertete    
  pn    
  printo e gabuar    
  kaq
